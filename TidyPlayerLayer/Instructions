About
----------

This small script adds a new option to the GameInstance compent called Player Layer, the script will then set the local player
characters gameobject and all children (nested too) to the selected Player Layer. Because of the way the asset is out of the box 
most child objects will use the Character Layer from the GameInstance and so I only change the layer of any child objects that is 
currently set to Character.
The script will change layers on entity awake, weapon change & equipment change events.

Why?
----------

While creating my UI I used a render texture to display the players character but because the player is set on the same layer as 
other players and enemies(NME) etc, if you was too close to another player / NME then you would see them in the UI too. This wasnt what 
I needed in my game and so I created this script.

How To Use
----------

1. Import the package to your project, nothing is overwritten
2. Add the UICameraHolder prefab to your GameInstance "Owning Character Objects"
3. Change the Player Layer on your GameInstance component to the desired layer e.g. Player
4. Add a new Raw Image to your UI where you would like your Character to be displayed & set the texture to the provided UICharacter render texture
5. Add your player layer to your Main Camera's "Culling Mask"
6. All done

Notes
----------

# You may have to re-assign the Target Texture on the UICameraHolder > Camera
# Dont forget to adjust the UICameraHolder > Camera transform & rotation if you cant see you character in your UI

Update Notes

1.0.1
FIX: The player layer is now only applied to child objects that have a "Renderer" component to fix issues with NPCs not attacking etc due to layers.
