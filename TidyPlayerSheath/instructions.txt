How To Use
----------

1. Add the following code to EquipmentModel.cs under public Vector3 localScale = Vector3.one; IMPORTANT!! Make a backup of your Core\Scripts\GameData\Item\Equipments\EquipmentModel.cs
	- [Header("Sheaf")]
      public string sheafSocket;
      public Vector3 sheafLocalPosition = Vector3.zero;
      public Vector3 sheafLocalEulerAngles = Vector3.zero;
      public Vector3 sheafLocalScale = Vector3.one;
2. Import the package to your project, nothing is overwritten
3. On your GameInstance gameobject add a new setting to the Input Settings Manager compnent, Key Name = Sheath ( Key Code can be any you like )
4. Add some Equipment Containers to your character model/s, Just like you do when setting up the hands for weapons.
5. Add your new equipment containers to your characters Animator Character Model component under 'Equipment Containers'
6. Edit your weapon/shield items to setup the settings for the sheaf point the 'Sheaf Socket' should be the name of the equipment container you would like to use
5. All done

Change Log v1.1.0
- Now works with both instantiated and none instantiated weapons ( Credit to Neomis for spotting this issue )
- Fixed an issue when sheathing and weapon sets, all should work as expected now ( Credit to Neomis for spotting this one too )
- Shields can be sheathed too!
- Should now work with items that have multiple equipment models
- Fixed an issue where you would have to press the sheath key twice before it worked
- Cleaned the code up

Known Issues
- Sheath position not fully synced when switching equipment sets

Todo
- Video tutorial
- Work on Sub Equipment Models sheathing positions
- Hook into the Animator Character Model component so we can use un/sheath animations that changes the weapon positions at the correct animation frame
- Display no equipped equipment items in their sheathed positions E.G: If you have a bow as your none equipped equipment set, it could sheath to the characters back. Suggested by Neomis
